# Transfer a domain to us
To transfer your domain to us, you can do this one of two ways:

1. Export a BIND file from your current host, generate an EPP code and send both to us
2. Provide us with login information to your current registrar/webhost and we can handle the transfer for you

To export a BIND file, see the instructions under "Change Nameservers" in the menu to the left for how to export a bind file for your host.

## Getting the EPP auth code
The auth code enables you to move your domain from one registrar to an other. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized transfers of domains. The code is unique to each domain and is valid for 60 days.
